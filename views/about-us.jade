      About CompassionPit
      -------------------
      The purpose of CompassionPit is to alleviate a specific kind of burden: to allow you to vent about something weighing you down without fear of it being used against you in the future.  I started it because I wanted it for myself and I realized how many people it would help. We're all more similar than we are different.
      
      The site went up in August 2010.
