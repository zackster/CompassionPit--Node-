split chat.jade into: listen.jade and vent.jade


- Mandatory listener test noreg??
listen->vent crasg


* show who your previous listener was - info box with ability to message them on the forums, assign them positive feedback, or assign them negative feedback



Each *User* instance has a property, an array, of previous partners - these are UIDs.
When you join a room, your dyad partner's User.id gets pushed to the array, partnerList




Whenever you get a new partner - the chat.js event/function is called - triggering a comm.request and gets the person's partnerList. it looks at partnerList[partnerList.length()-2] and returns it to the comm.request's callback function, which displays them.  a javascript $("#MostRecentChatPartner").html() is what happens.
Chat.jade needs a #MOstRecentChatPartner div


function getPreviousPartner() {
	
	x = User;// get the User object for the person sending the comm request
	authServer.getUsernameFromListenerId(User.partner_list[User.partner_list.length()-2]);
	


}


* when you rate someone positive, or negative, optionally give them feedback or cancel it

Before it sends the event, hide it and replace it with a new form, then you need to create the form, and have a submit button, and when the submit button is clicked THEN the comm/event ( from word^5) and also include the additional-comments
   

* figure out why leaderboard isn't updating for users in real-time ... e.g. why doesn't "Zachary Burt" have any points?

* figure out how many negative feedbacks have been assigned to Users with forum usernames... group by syntax, and paste it here

* call joe esposito and figure out "getting started guide" for flaskDijscrape


* create roleplay fetish chat site
