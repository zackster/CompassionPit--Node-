Discoveries:
> url of 'venter' or 'listener' renders views/chat.jade

> i didn't know what 'use strict' means or does, so i looked it up:
  It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.
  It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively "unsafe" actions are taken 
    (such as gaining access to the global object).
  It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.
  "not in Firefox 3.6, Safari 5, Chrome 7 and Opera 10.6 (all Mac). 
  Didn't test in IE9 though ;) â€“ Nov 10 '10	  
  Firefox 4 has complete support for strict mode, and as far as I can tell, no other browser does.
  Safari and Chrome have "partial" support, but I don't really know what that means."

> took a few minutes to figure out that socketHanders class is not defined somewhere;
  it is created on the fly in mergeServers() in app.js.
  
> not seeing how button was implemented in chat.jade until i realized it is in static/chat.js.

> finally dawned that 'type' in chat.jade line 'window.CLIENT_TYPE = !{JSON.stringify(type)};'
  is passed in with the render() call.
  
> Rooms class defined in rooms/models.js. The queues for venters/listeners are there.

> <User>.lookupGeoIP(callback) is called to get geo info.
> <User>.send(message) is called to have message displayed in users chat window.
 
Not Understood:
> what is the config item 'serveMerged' mean? it is set 'true' in config.
> what are hashes and where created? referenced in 'mergeStatic(function (jsHash, cssHash){}'.
> so chat.jade is source for html, but no header tag or linking of js files or css file?
  how does jade know to use static/chat.js and static/css/style.css? is that a feature of jade?
